    <h1>creating/pulling a repo</h1>

    <ol><h2>Steps</h2></ol>
<ol>
    <h3><li>Creation</li></h3>
    <p>Step 1 is creating the repo, this is done by going to Github and in the top right there should a plus symbol that you click to create it</p>
    <p><em>Note: it is best to include a README file when creating this repo</em></p>

    <h3><li>Copying/Cloning</li></h3>
    <p>So now our Repo exists its time to get it onto our computer and start coding and adding to it, on the repo page on Github click the green code button and copy the SSH URL</p>
    <p><em>Note: Very important you click on the SSH option to copy the code as if you do not it won't work properly</em></p>

    <h3><li>Directory</li></h3>
    <p>It is recommended to create a directory specifically for repos, to create a repo do the <st>mkdir</st> command, then move into said directory with the <strong> command </strong></p>
    <p>Once you have created and moved into te directory you clone your project into here using the following command <strong>( git clone SSH URL )</strong></p>
    <p><em>Note:The pasted ssh key should look like this git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git there should be <strong>No</strong> https at the beginning, if there is then you've copied the wrong URL</em></p>

    <h3><li>Moving</li></h3>
    <P>Now the repo and our local files should be connected, to confirm it connected correctly you can move into the new folder (using cd) that was created then do the command <strong>( git remote -v )</strong> which should display the url to the relevant repo</P>
    <p>I'm assuming the index,html or whatever files were created before the repo linking, so what you should do now is close visual studio code if you have it open to avoid any errors, then find the path to the repo file using cd and the target files using a combination of cd and ls, once you find the targe path do the <strong>( mv )</strong> command then target the file you want to move followed by the target destination, example <strong>( mv Downloads/test1.txt    repos/tests )</strong> </p>

    <h3><li>Changes</li></h3>
    <p>Any changes made in this directory will need to be pushed for it to show on your repo, changes include any modifications even deletion of a file or renaming</p>
    <P>If you did move some files to this new repo directory you will already have a change ready to be staged, if you didn't you can just create a text file using the touch command</P>
    <p>Now once you've made a change if you do the command <strong>( git status )</strong> it should show your current file in red which indicates it's not staged, to stage any changes made you do <strong>( git add NameOfFile.txt )</strong> if you do the git status command again it should now show your file/s in green indicating they're ready for a commit</p>
    <p><em>Note: if you want to add multiple files to the staging area you do <strong>( git add . )</strong> and this adds all files to the staging area</em></p>

    <h3><li>Committing</li></h3>
    <p>The next stage after you've added your changes to the staging area is to commit these changes, the purpose of a commit is to make it easier to navigate the versions of your files and see what changes were made (especially useful when working with others) so its always best these contain a lot of accurate information</p>
    <p>To do a commit you do the commands <strong>( git commit -m "message describing what you've done" )</strong>, if you want a real life example, before I push these changes to my repo my commit command is going to look like this $ git commit -m "expanded step 5: changes, added step 6: committing, typo fixes"</p>
    <P><em>Note: sometimes you might forgot what you've added, deleted or changed so what I like to do is have a txt document opened while coding and update it as I go along so the commit message is very accurate, also make sure your actual commit message is within speech marks " "</em></P>

    <h3><li>Pushing (p)</li></h3>
    <p>At this point all you code is staged, committed and finally ready to be pushed, which is the term git uses to 'push' a file change live to the repo in this case</p>
    <P>Just to make do a final check do git status and it should show your latest commit comment, if it does then do <strong>( git push )</strong> and that should be it</P>
    <P><em>Note: to check all pushes and commit you can do the command <strong>( git log )</strong> and this should show that information in reverse chronological order as well as who made the commit and when, if you have a lot of commits and pushes you can use the arrow keys to go down the list if not everything shown and to exit the log you simply press the letter "q" on your keyboard</em></P>
