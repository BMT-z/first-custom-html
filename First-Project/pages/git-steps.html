    <h1>creating/pulling a repo</h1>

    <ol><h2>Steps</h2></ol>
<ol>
    <h3><li>Creation</li></h3>
    <p>Step 1 is creating the repo, this is done by going to Github and in the top right there should a plus symbol that you click to create it</p>
    <p><em>Note: it is best to include a README file when creating this repo</em></p>

    <h3><li>Copying/Cloning</li></h3>
    <p>So now our Repo exists its time to get it onto our computer and start coding and adding to it, on the repo page on Github click the green code button and copy the SSH URL</p>
    <p><em>Note: Very important you click on the SSH option to copy the code as if you do not it won't work properly</em></p>

    <h3><li>Directory</li></h3>
    <p>It is recommended to create a directory specifically for repos, to create a repo do the <st>mkdir</st> command, then move into said directory with the <strong> command </strong></p>
    <p>Once you have created and moved into te directory you clone your project into here using the following command <strong>( git clone SSH URL )</strong></p>
    <p><em>Note:The pasted ssh key should look like this git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git there should be <strong>No</strong> https at the beginning, if there is then you've copied the wrong URL</em></p>

    <h3><li>Moving</li></h3>
    <P>Now the repo and our local files should be connected, to confirm it connected correctly you can move into the new folder (using cd) that was created then do the command <strong>( git remote -v )</strong> which should display the url to the relevant repo</P>
    <p>I'm assuming the index,html or whatever files were created before the repo linking, so wht you should do now is close visual studio code if you have it open to avoid any errors, then find the path to the repo file using cd and the target files using a combination of cd and ls, once you find the targe path do the <strong>( mv )</strong> command then target the file you want to move followed by the target destination, example <strong>( mv Downloads/test1.txt Documents/tests )</strong> </p>
