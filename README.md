PURPOSE

Everything I learn I will write down on this repo to solidify the learnt information, doing this should further my understanding as I believe you don't really know something well enough until you can teach it to someone else, which is why all my learnt information is being written in the style of a tutorial, this also has the benefit of showing my progression with coding and using git/Github as well as serving as an index of everything I've learnt which i can use to jog my memory if I take a break and forgot how to do something.

The reason why this is a repo is because I want to get into the habit of doing regular commits and also have a backup of my code incase I mess something up, if this does happen I can easily revert to a working version by taking advantage of the VCS of git/Github; furthermore, I believe using the VCS is a cool way to document how my coding knowledge has expanded (hopefully) over time.
